* Helm Dynamic Dev Environment

The provided docker image is hosted on dockerhub at
kalonlkelley/helm-dynamic-dev-env

** Building Locally

The docker image can also be built locally with the following command
#+begin_src bash
  docker build -f Dockerfile --tag kalonlkelley/helm-dynamic-dev-env:latest .
#+end_src
If a multiarch builder is used (or just buildx is preferred) then use this
command
#+begin_src bash
  docker buildx --platform linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 \
         --tag kalonlkelley/helm-dynamic-dev-env:latest .
#+end_src

** Running a Container

In order to run the container use the following command from the directory which
you will be creating charts in. This will automatically pull the docker image
from dockerhub so no need to build locally prior.
#+begin_src bash
  docker run --privileged --rm -itdv $(pwd):/charts --name [NAME] \
         kalonlkelley/helm-dynamic-dev-env:latest server --snapshotter native
#+end_src
Where [NAME] is the name of your container.

In order to now enter the container for using helm run the following command
#+begin_src bash
  docker exec -it [NAME] /bin/sh
#+end_src

When you are all done to stop the container run
#+begin_src bash
  docker stop [NAME]
#+end_src
