* Helm Dynamic Dev Environment

The provided docker image is hosted on dockerhub at
kalonlkelley/helm-dynamic-dev-env

** Building Locally

The docker image can also be built locally with the following command if a
multiarch builder is used
#+begin_src bash
  docker buildx --platform linux/arm/v7,linux/arm64/v8,linux/amd64 \
         --tag kalonlkelley/helm-dynamic-dev-env:latest .
#+end_src

** Running a Container

In order to run the container use the following command
#+begin_src bash
  docker run --rm -it kalonlkelley/helm-dynamic-dev-env
#+end_src

The working directory inside the container is `/charts` which can be mounted
over like in the following example
#+begin_src bash
  docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/charts helm-dynamic-dev-env
#+end_src

If you are trying to test a development version of helm which you have cloned
locally in your working directory you can have the container build and use that
by mounting it to the directory `/helm-src` and providing the `--rebuild` flag
#+begin_src bash
  docker run --rm -it -v $(pwd):/helm-src helm-dynamic-dev-env --rebuild
#+end_src
